We’re excited to announce the release of Material Design Components (MDC) 1.4.0! A host of exciting new features have been added along with many bug fixes and accessibility improvements. Get the rundown below.

Make sure to check out the [release notes](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/releases/tag/1.4.0), and if you’re using MDC for the first time, take a look at our [getting started guide](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started).

## What’s new in 1.4.0?

A fair bit has changed since `1.3.0` launched in February – we added the navigation rail component, added support for motion theming, and more. The things you loved from the alpha, beta, and RC releases of `1.4.0` are now officially stable. If you haven’t yet started using `1.4.0` of MDC, there’s never been a better time to update.

#### NavigationRailView

Navigation rails provide ergonomic movement between primary destinations in apps. The rail is a side navigation component that displays three to seven app destinations and, optionally, a Floating Action Button. Each destination is represented by an icon and a text label.

MDC `1.4.0` allows you to use navigation rails in your Android app with the `NavigationRailView` widget. It has a similar API to `NavigationView` but has additional features to support Material Design Guidance for Large Screens.

Learn more about how to implement navigation rails in our [documentation](https://material.io/components/navigation-rail/android).

#### Motion theming

[Material motion](https://material.io/design/motion/the-motion-system.html) provides a set of transition patterns that help users understand and navigate an app.

We introduced material motion in MDC [`1.2.1`](https://material.io/blog/android-stable-release-1-2) and have added many improvements since then. MDC `1.4.0` allows you to specify duration, easing, and path values for the Material motion classes — `MaterialContainerTransform`, `MaterialSharedAxis`, `MaterialFadeThrough`, and `MaterialFade` — with new theme attributes, similar to color, typography, and shape attributes.

Learn more about how to implement motion and how the new theme attributes map to the relevant classes in our [documentation](https://material.io/develop/android/theming/motion).
