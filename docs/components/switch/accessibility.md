# Switch

Switches toggle the selection of an item on or off

## Accessibility

## Use cases

People should be able to do the following with assistive technology:

-   Navigate to a switch with a keyboard or switch input

-   Toggle the switch on and off

-   Get appropriate feedback based on input type documented under [Interaction & style](accessibility.md#c0e9fae1-48df-428b-b028-4f7be071ada3)

## Interaction & style

The switch handle increases in size to indicate interactivity for both touch and cursor control interactions.

**Touch**
When tapped or dragged, the handle size grows, providing interaction feedback.

**Cursor**
When hovered (in both on and off states), the hover area grows, providing a visual cue that the handle is interactive. When clicked, the handle size grows.

_Touch: Tap, Drag_

_Cursor: Hover, Click_

### Avoid applying density by default

Don't apply density to switches by default — this lowers their targets below our best practice of 48x48 CSS pixels. Instead, give people a way to choose a higher density, like selecting a denser layout or changing the theme.

To ensure that this density setting can easily be reverted when it's active, keep all targets to change it at a minimum 48x48 CSS pixels each.

## Initial focus

Initial focus lands directly on the switch’s handle, since it’s the primary interactive element of the component.

## Keyboard navigation

| Keys | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Tab** | Focus lands on the switch handle |
| **Space** or **Enter** | Toggles the handle on and off |

## Labeling elements

The accessibility label for a switch uses the adjacent label text if implemented correctly. 

Assistive tech such as a screen reader will read the UI text followed by the component’s role.

![“Dark theme” is the switch’s adjacent label text and the accessibility label.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmg695w5m-05.png?alt=media&token=dda98de5-3d58-48c6-bf03-15d563c4e742>)

_A switch’s accessibility label can incorporate its adjacent UI text_

When the visible UI text is ambiguous, accessibility labels need to be more descriptive. For example, a switch visibly labelled **Photo album** would benefit from additional information to clarify the switch’s function.

Consider making the adjacent label text more descriptive when possible. This reduces the need for different accessibility text.

![The accessibility label for the switch is “Photo album access” though the label text is “photo album.”](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmg698bn2-06.png?alt=media&token=5ef0f417-dae7-4548-8214-6003ed547f91>)

_While the visible label text reads Photo album, the accessibility label for this switch clarifies its function: Photo album access_
