# Dialogs

Dialogs provide important prompts in a user flow

## Accessibility

## Use cases

People should be able to use assistive technology to:

-   Open and close a dialog
-   Provide and submit other inputs if the dialog is interactive, such as a text field or selectable list
-   Scroll the dialog to access all of its contents if that content extends beyond the container of the dialog

## Interaction & style

### Use sparingly

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive. This means they appear in front of app content and disrupt the flow of content for people who may, for example, be using a screen reader to navigate the page.

As such, dialogs should be used sparingly and only to provide critical information. Less critical information should be presented in a non-blocking way within the flow of app content.

![An inline tooltip doesn’t block a photo app’s content on a mobile screen.
A modal dialog blocks the content of a photo app on a mobile screen.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fm8sgve0z-01_do.png?alt=media&token=15a731c6-5d4e-4b65-afb3-23b6275d0935>)

_Present non-critical information using other UI within the flow of app content_

![A modal dialog blocks the content of a photo app on a mobile screen.

_Avoid putting non-critical information in a dialog_

### 200% text size

Avoid excessive text wrapping or truncation by choosing concise strings. 

On Android, headlines should be kept concise enough to fit within **four** lines after the text size is increased to 200%. If a headline exceeds this limit and gets truncated, provide an alternative way to access the full content in a single tap.

![A dialog with 200% text wraps multiple times in the header and description. It covers most of the mobile screen.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fm8sh8mb2-03_caution.png?alt=media&token=f2a9bb8e-dfb7-46a9-a33f-20f895f8a834>)

_Avoid excessive text wrapping or truncation by choosing concise strings_

### Elements within dialogs

Because dialogs can contain various elements within them, refer to the relevant accessibility guidelines for each element. 

Some common examples include:

1.  Text fields
2.  Typography
3.  Buttons

![3 elements of a full-screen dialog.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fm8x3m4cu-04.png?alt=media&token=4e645417-fc9a-48de-a66f-a3b5c5d16723>)

_Full-screen dialogs can contain various elements such as (1) text fields, (2) typography, and (3) buttons, which each may have their own accessibility guidelines_

## Initial focus

When a dialog appears, focus should automatically land on the first interactive element within the dialog.

![A modal dialog titled “Permanently delete?” whose second interactive element is focused by selecting the Tab key.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fm8wqpp2r-05.png?alt=media&token=d5214cf8-9fa2-458f-9e17-5db4e07235ba>)

_Initial focus lands on the first interactive element within a dialog. The tab key moves focus through the next interactive elements in a cycle._

![A modal dialog titled “Permanently delete?” whose previous interactive element is focused on by selecting both the Shift and Tab keys.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fm8wqq56l-06.png?alt=media&token=2eae0221-4a71-4ca5-b873-6d3bf94cbd23>)

_The shift and tab keys together move focus in the opposite direction. The space or enter key triggers or commits the action of the focused element._

## Keyboard navigation

| Keys | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | Focus lands on the next interactive element contained in the dialog, or the first element if focus is currently on the last element |
| Shift + Tab | Focus lands on the previous interactive element contained in the dialog, or the last element if focus is currently on the first element |
| Space or Enter | Triggers or commits the action of the focused element |
| Escape | Closes the dialog |

## Labeling elements

The accessibility label for a dialog is typically the same as the dialog’s title or headline.

On web, basic dialogs should have the **alert dialog** role.

![An alert dialog with a title “Set up traffic updates?”  Its label is “Set up traffic updates?” and its role as “Alert Dialog.”](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmk2a1j0z-07.png?alt=media&token=f67fa051-a23b-4607-a062-bcd540ddcaef>)

_Basic dialogs are known as alert dialogs on web_

Components contained within the dialog, such as buttons, should be labeled according to the guidelines specific to those components.

For common examples, see:

-   Buttons
-   Text fields

![A full-screen dialog titled “New event” containing a “Save” button and a text field, both with their own accessibility labels.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmk2a20m5-08.png?alt=media&token=0478cb5e-0c5f-4154-9888-0ba7de7a3247>)
