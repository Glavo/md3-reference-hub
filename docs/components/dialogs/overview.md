# Dialogs

Dialogs provide important prompts in a user flow

## Overview

-   Use dialogs to make sure users act on information

-   Two variants: basic and full-screen

-   Should be dedicated to completing a single task

-   Can also display information relevant to the task

-   Commonly used to confirm high-risk actions like deleting progress
