# Icon buttons

Icon buttons help people take minor actions with one tap

## Overview

-   Icon buttons must use a system icon with a clear meaning

-   Two variants: default and toggle

-   Many configurations: Color, size, width, and shape

-   On web, display a tooltip describing the action while hovering

-   In toggle buttons, use the outlined style of an icon for the unselected state, and the filled style for the selected state
