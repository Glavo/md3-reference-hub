# Badges

Badges show notifications, counts, or status information on navigation items and icons

## Accessibility

## Use cases

People should be able to use assistive technology to:

-   Understand the dynamic information conveyed in badges, such as counts or labels
-   Address badge announcements by selecting corresponding navigation destinations

## Interaction & style

Badges are most commonly used within other components, such as navigation bar, navigation rail, app bars, and tabs.

When a badge is used to indicate an unread notification, the badge gets hidden once it's selected.

## Visual indicators

Badges use a color intended to stand out against labels, icons, and navigation elements. Use the default color mapping to avoid color conflict issues.

_Badges must use default color with at least 3:1 contrast_

_Avoid using custom color roles for the badge container and label text. If custom roles are necessary, make sure they have contrast of at least 3:1._

## Labeling elements

The accessibility label for a badge item will be read after its navigation destination. Any numerical badges will have their number read, while non-counting badges will simply announce **New notification**.
