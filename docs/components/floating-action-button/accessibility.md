# FABs

## Accessibility

## Use cases

People should be able to do the following using assistive technology:

-   Navigate to and activate the FAB 

-   Perform an action with the FAB 

-   Expand and minimize an extended FAB

## Interaction & style

Don't disable the FAB. If the action represented in the FAB is unavailable, the FAB shouldn't appear.

Ensure the icon has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the container.

_FAB icons are above the 3:1 contrast ratio_

_Avoid using colors with a contrast below 3:1_

## Focus

Ensure the FAB is prioritized in the overall focus order to create an efficient experience for people who navigate UIs with assistive tech. 

On mobile, the focus order may start with the app bar, move to the navigation bar, and then skip past any other content on the page to land on the FAB.

Consider displaying a tooltip when the FAB is focused. This is supported on web.

## Layout & position

To make it easier for users of screen readers to reach a primary action such as a FAB on expanded window sizes, consider placing the FAB in the upper left region. 

However, it’s critical to test placement options with users to see if the upper left region is the best position in all browser windows. For compact and medium window sizes, the best place for the FAB is the lower right corner of a screen.

_In compact windows, place the FAB in the bottom trailing edge_

![FAB in the upper left region of a large screen.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmkaqcdup-05.png?alt=media&token=f735b608-ff59-4ef5-b166-b7ab5542cb36>)

_In expanded windows, place the FAB in the navigation rail_

To ensure accessibility for keyboard users on the web, avoid positioning the FAB in a way that completely obscures the focus indicator of an actionable element. 

It’s okay to partially cover the desired element, as long as the focus indicators are still visible.

## Keyboard navigation

| **Keys** | **Actions** |
| --- | --- |
| **Tab** | Focus lands on the FAB |
| **Space** or **Enter** | Perform the default action on an item |

## Labeling elements

The accessibility label should describe the action that the button is performing, such as **Compose a new message**.
