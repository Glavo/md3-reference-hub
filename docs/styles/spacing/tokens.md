# Spacing

Spacing is the distance around and between component and layout elements

## Tokens

Note:

The spacing system tokens are only used on Jetpack Compose.

## System spacing tokens

### MEASUREMENT

Component: Sliders

System spacing tokens are a linear range of spacing values recommended by Material. They’re intended to cover the majority of spacing needs within the design system. The base unit of measurement **md.sys.measurement.space100** is **8dp**. [Learn more about design tokens](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/design-tokens/overview/)

_The main spacing units are multiples of 8dp_

### Nested units

Values other than multiples of 8 are also used in layouts and Material components, like 2dp, 4dp, 6dp, and 10dp. Material only defines the most recommended nested units.

_Material only defines nested units that are actively used in common layouts or Material components_

## Component spacing

Most Material component spacing attributes will map to system spacing tokens. Spacing logic, like adaptive design or density, should be applied to the component attribute.

Component attributes follow a new naming strategy:

-   Going forward, all component spacing attributes will use **padding**, **margin**, and **gap**, and positional language: **horizontal**, **vertical**, **leading**, **trailing**, **top**, and **bottom**

    -   Example: “Medium button: leading padding”


-   Past component spacing tokens use “**space**” to describe all padding, gaps, and margins, like **leading-space**, **trailing-space**, **top-space**, **bottom-space**, and **between-space**.

    -   Example: “Medium button: leading space”
