# Elevation

Elevation is the distance between two surfaces on the z-axis

## Overview

-   Elevation is applied to all surfaces and components
-   Tokens codify the distance on the z-axis to ensure components appear consistently relative to each other
-   Tokens have no shadows or color; each platform determines the specific shadows and values to use at each elevation level
-   Elevation can be shown as tonal surface colors or shadows
-   Avoid changing the default elevation of Material 3 components
-   Stick to using a small amount of elevation levels

Elevation is measured as the distance between components along the z-axis in density-independent pixels (dps).

A second one shows a side view of the squares in elevation, showing that the light square is lower in elevation than the dark square.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwykafum-1.png?alt=media&token=686eda7a-aed0-4d34-a749-0b01f2a50a86>)

_Elevation represents the distance between elements. The product applies color to represent elevation. One surface at 1dp elevation and another surface at 8dp elevation, as viewed from the front; The difference in elevation between the two surfaces is 7dp, as viewed from the side_

## Differences from M2

-   Shadows: Instead of applying shadows by default to all levels, use shadows only when required to create additional protection against a background or to encourage interaction
-   Color: New color mappings and compatibility with dynamic color
-   Levels: Elevation is now described in terms of levels

_M2: Shadows applied at all levels_

_M3: Using color instead of shadows to communicate elevation_

## All surfaces and components have elevation values

Surfaces at different elevations do the following:

1.  Allow surfaces to move in front of and behind other surfaces, such as content scrolling behind app bars

2.  Reflect spatial relationships, such as how a FAB's shadow indicates it's separate from a card collection

3.  Focus attention on the highest elevation, such as a dialog temporarily appearing in front of other surfaces

### Resting elevation (default)

All components have a default resting elevation. Avoid changing the default elevation of Material components.

_All components have a default elevation which should be used_

### Changing elevation

Components should change elevation in response to system events or user interaction, like hovering. This elevation change should be consistent across all similar elements.

For example, hovering a FAB temporarily increases the elevation by 1 level, from level 3 to level 4. All Material buttons increase elevation by 1 level when hovered.
