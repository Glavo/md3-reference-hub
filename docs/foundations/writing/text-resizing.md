# Writing and text

Ensure text is helpful, clear, and resilient to change

## Text resizing

## Text resizing

### Background

People with low vision or those who prefer large text must be able to scale up the size of text in a UI. This adjustment is often performed through a device OS setting or in-app option.

UIs should support a minimum text increase of 200%.

Most components behave the same when text is resized:

-   Text and line height scale up proportionally, multiplied by scale value
-   Padding remains constant at 1x the default size
-   Spacing between elements in a component remain constant at 1x the default size

![Padding is the same on the top and bottom edges of the buttons.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5gijr-8.png?alt=media&token=76c97c12-c912-435f-aca9-f06637257b7b>)

_Button text displayed at 1x, 1.3x, and 2x scales. All have top and bottom padding of 8dp._

![Button text displayed at 1x, 1.3x, and 2x scales. All have left and right padding of 24dp.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5gt05-9.png?alt=media&token=876f39d6-c14f-4d45-bd7c-d945f82fff12>)

_Left and right padding remains constant at 24dp as the text size increases._

When text resizing isn't controlled by the device OS, offer multipliers such as 1.5x or 2x to allow users to increase the text size. Using multipliers to scale text can result in values with decimals, but this approach is more feasible for implementation.

To calculate a font's size using multipliers, take the **default** **font size** (density = 0) and **multiply it by the scale value**.

![Button with label text at 1x and 2x scale.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5h7wy-10.png?alt=media&token=821d0159-4996-4342-a717-15f3a5d3b375>)

_For example, if a font is 14pt at 1x scale, then the font size should be 28pt when enlarged to 2x scale: (14pt) x (scale value 2) = 28._

Components that don't include text, like progress indicators, checkboxes, or radio buttons, aren't affected by text resizing.

![Icon button with the icon shown at 1x scale and incorrectly at 2x scale.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5hl59-11.png?alt=media&token=0d6620aa-6743-4478-b6a8-cec7da279ca7>)

_When designing for text resizing, don't resize components without text_

![Menu with labels at 1x scale.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5hzv6-12.png?alt=media&token=0fbdf847-88fa-4bb6-86bd-7827ef797454>)

_UI text displayed at 1x_

![Menu with labels at 2x scale.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5iftq-13.png?alt=media&token=8b0674ad-6a2b-40a2-a54f-88e499dd6ae9>)

_UI text displayed at 2x in which only text and line height is enlarged; the padding between components remains the same as in the 1x UI._

### Designing for large type

Large type is used regularly by people with low vision and those with difficulty processing written words. They tend to increase text size:

-   To make it easier to read

-   To limit interruptions and focus on one task

-   To avoid overwhelming their senses

Use these methods to design a product to handle large type properly.

_Text that is too small and dense can appear overwhelming and difficult to read_

![Menu with labels at 1x scale.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fm4bi7fz7-13-a.png?alt=media&token=ece17269-405b-472a-9c38-4d087535740d>)

_Larger text can help people focus on one decision at a time and improve understanding_

### Methods

Avoid common text resizing issues by increasing container size, reflowing layout, enabling scrolling, and adding tooltips.

_Unresponsive container; unintentionally clipped text; Unresponsive text; Overlapping elements; Unwanted truncation_

#### **Increase container size**

Resizing containers can prevent text from overlapping, clipping, or truncating.

Consider how text might reflow in a way that allows the eye to follow the end of one line to the beginning of the following line.


#### **Reflow the layout**

Consider reflowing the layout, especially when components grow very long. To accommodate larger text, components can be stacked on top of one another, rather than fixed side-by-side.

![ left: buttons placed side-by-side. Right: buttons stacked on top of one another.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5jdor-15.png?alt=media&token=82a605c0-5cc9-4d32-897e-d07133b39012>)

_UI displayed at 1x: buttons positioned side-by-side in a standard layout; UI displayed at 2x: buttons stacked to fit the limited horizontal width after text is resized_

#### **Enable content to scroll**

When long strings of enlarged text don’t fit on one screen, consider adding a scrollbar to provide access to more content.

Vertical scrolling is preferable to horizontal. Users should only be asked to scroll in one direction, rather than both vertically and horizontally.

![Dialog with a lot of text at 2x size. The text is cut off but accessible when scrolling.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5ldz9-16.png?alt=media&token=164a658d-4e2a-4d67-a35c-c4cb051f3389>)

_Some screens may not be able to resize and display necessary content. In this situation a scrollbar can be used to access more text._

#### **Use touch & hold tooltips to provide enlarged labels**

Some components, such as app bars and navigation bars, position text in spaces with stricter space and character limits. In these situations, you can add a tooltip to display enlarged content in the UI.

In this case, the text size in the component remains displayed at 1x while the scaled up text is displayed in a tooltip on touch & hold.

Tooltips are the best choice for displaying enlarged text in:  

-   Top app bar
-   Navigation bar
-   Navigation rail
-   Tabs, when fixed to the top of a screen and don’t move off-screen upon scrolling

![Tooltip on navigation rail displays scaled up label text.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Flwj5lr50-17.png?alt=media&token=c1272c3a-bf9b-473d-a942-4bb2c3221ffd>)

_Scale up text in an adjacent tooltip to maintain space in a UI for consuming content._
