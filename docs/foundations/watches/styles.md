# Design for watches

Watches have special design considerations and interaction patterns

## Typography

M3 Expressive adds two type styles specially designed for watches. [More on the type scale for Wear OS](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/wear/guides/styles/typography/type-scale-tokens)

### Numerals

Numeral text styles display numbers, usually only a few digits at a time. This text can take on more expressive properties at larger display sizes without the accommodations usually required by text that must be localized.

![A watch face with an indication for the numeral text style used to show the time.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bgujn-22.png?alt=media&token=ee819057-6848-4286-ab25-4dfb4afc041d>)

### Arc text

Arc text is specially designed for text following a curved path on a round screen, such as page titles, confirmation overlays, or a call to action. It optimizes character spacing for text displayed along a curve at the top or bottom of a round screen.

## Color

Material for Wear OS provides a custom [color system](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/wear/guides/styles/color/system) to create vibrant experiences and clear visual hierarchy.

### Build from black

Watches are designed with a black background, instead of the tinted background that phones use.

![2 watch screens showing sleeping app and a number picker.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bibde-1.png?alt=media&token=01d22ede-66f4-499f-9cea-fc99b02a094d>)

_Watches use a black background to conserve battery_

### Color roles

Since watches are used throughout the day, color tokens for Wear OS are specifically tailored for dark themes in low-light environments and light themes for daylight environments.

[More on color roles for Wear OS](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/wear/guides/styles/color/roles-tokens)

![3 examples of “Accept” and “Decline” buttons that are legible.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bjd95-21.png?alt=media&token=a6be592c-d586-41ca-bdab-8b45edba0384>)

_Buttons with (2) on primary on (1) primary and (4) on primary container on (3) primary container stay legible as the contrast level changes_

![2 of 3 “Accept” buttons and 1 of 3 “Decline” buttons are shown with poor contrast.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bkn4t-22.png?alt=media&token=044f9f67-1b01-4c25-b220-070fd45c5309>)

_Buttons with (2) primary dim on (1) primary or (4) primary dim on (3) primary container become illegible as contrast levels shift_

### Recommended color combinations for Wear OS

Below are some common color pairings that can help establish priority, function, and elevation.

-   Use **primary dim** to highlight important elements and **tertiary** to provide standout feedback, such as tap responses

-   When the main action isn't clear, use **tertiary** and **primary** for main actions and **secondary container** for complementary actions

-   Use **secondary** and **primary container** to show two equally important options or containers, while maintaining contrast

![Three buttons, with the center one in Primary and side ones in Primary Dim. ](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bls9w-23.png?alt=media&token=e0460e47-5b07-4718-9886-ff9ae4507387>)

_Primary; Primary dim_

![ A number pad with most keys in Primary Dim and the pressed key in Tertiary. ](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bmhyv-24.png?alt=media&token=70b6affe-2f16-48d9-8b3d-8ad6ae9e8c52>)

_Primary dim; Tertiary_

![Call button in tertiary color, open button in primary color and open on phone button in secondary-container.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bn2dm-28.png?alt=media&token=5d900226-94f1-4ffa-ab04-5e66b97ade6f>)

_Tertiary; Primary; Secondary container_

![accept button in primary and delete button in primary container.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bnriq-30.png?alt=media&token=526ca426-6747-4ffb-a78d-859d48226cea>)

_Primary; Tertiary; Primary container_

![Plus button in primary color, date button is in tertiary color and appointment summary is in primary container color.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bof6i-27.png?alt=media&token=b55bcefd-46f0-4f73-a4aa-0d224e3a44df>)

_Primary dim; Tertiary dim_

![Bicycle button in primary, weight button in tertiary dim.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bp0a1-31.png?alt=media&token=6ed1448e-b9a0-43de-8f3a-5b12703214e4>)

_Primary; Tertiary dim_

## Motion

The [M3 motion system](../../styles/motion/overview/how-it-works.md) makes interactions feel more alive, fluid, and natural. Well-designed transitions make an experience feel high quality and expressive, and give intuitive feedback to understand how an app works. [More on transitions in Wear OS](../../styles/motion/transitions/transition-patterns.md)

## Haptics

Haptics are tactile effects used to grab a person’s attention for something important, or add emphasis to an interaction on the screen. You can use haptics to provide responsive feedback to scrolling and selecting items from a list, or controlling volume.

Use system-defined patterns and tokens (when available) to reinforce interaction expectations. Synchronize haptics with UI motion and sound to provide richer feedback.

-   Use stronger haptics for key interactions, such as a payment confirmation

-   Use subtler haptics for precision interactions, such as scrolling through a list

![2 watch faces with lines indicating haptics for a payment being accepted and scrolling through notifications.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp5bqjda-x.png?alt=media&token=f959184f-0564-471c-8246-786620986080>)

_Use stronger haptics for key interactions and subtler feedback for precision interactions_
