# Design for watches

Watches have special design considerations and interaction patterns

## Anatomy

### The watch face

Watch faces display the time, as well as  other information and can provide access to other functions through apps and tiles.

They can also include complications, self-contained details that can show contextual info like heart rate or progress.

Ongoing activities on the watch face show in-progress actions, like a stopwatch countdown or a workout timer.

_Complications are details on the watch face that can be customized for style or function_

### Physical buttons

Wearable devices can have a variety input surfaces, which include physical buttons and controls.

_Rotating side buttons: Used for volume control, or to scroll through options or lists; System buttons: Dedicated to OS functions like powering on and off, and cannot be customized; Multifunction buttons: Used by apps for custom actions like starting and stopping a stopwatch_

## Design principles

-   Tailor layouts for different screen sizes with [adaptive design](layout.md#63f04f40-d4ad-4d7e-8284-b57749ed810a)

-   Design for short interactions to conserve battery

-   Focus on one or two tasks at a time rather than a full app experience

-   Test designs in situations that involve movement to make sure the design is usable at a glance

_At-a-glance views allow people to quickly see calendar events_

_Don't create complex and detailed apps such as a calendar grid_

### Always relevant

Watches are always with people. Consider how to update app content based on context, such as time, place, and activity.

_Navigation on a watch complements the experience on a phone_

### Works offline

Design for slow connections and offline use, such as exercising and commuting.

![2 watches: 1 with offline music downloads list. 1 with a dialog about no internet connection with dismiss and accept buttons.](../../../assets/images/45f8a6f00680-mp5bxqx4-08.png)

_The network state can be communicated through: An offline icon; A dialog_

## Interaction patterns

### Cross-device experiences

Watches are often dependent on connected phones for functionality or complex interactions. In some cases, a watch and a phone are used together to accomplish different parts of the same task.

Consider how experiences can be consistent and complement the strengths of each device.

![A contact entry shown on a phone and a watch, with options to call or message.](../../../assets/images/a67663a3bf59-mp5byzmd-09-do.png)

_Consider which actions are appropriate for each device_

### Always on displays

Watches can have always on displays, which allow ambient content to be shown when the watch isn’t in use.

This are especially helpful for ongoing experiences like a timer or a workout that should remain in view. Because they remain on the screen for long time periods, consider limiting the number of pixels that are illuminated.
