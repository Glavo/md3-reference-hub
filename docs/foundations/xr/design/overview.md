# Design for immersive XR

Resources and guidance for immersive extended reality (XR) devices

![Design for immersive XR](../../../../assets/images/c96d3c3a1421-mp6oo483-hero-image.png)

## Overview

-   Use depth and expanded space to create believable environments

-   Map interactions, like gaze and gestures, to real-world expectations

-   Group UI elements on floating spatial panels

-   Design for comfort to minimize motion sickness and physical strain

-   Provide feedback through spatial audio, haptics, and visual cues

## Principles

### Use familiar patterns

Material components like buttons and menus help people navigate spatial apps with confidence.

![A button opens to show a 3D Material menu.](../../../../assets/images/2dda1a3ce9f9-moxbsbzn-Spatialize_Components_10.gif)

_In XR, a Material menu uses elevation to appear in 3D_

### Prioritize comfort

Place content in the center of a person’s field of view, and design for different body positions, such as seated, standing, and reclined.

![A person sitting in a chair in an immersive XR environment, with lines marking their field of view.](../../../../assets/images/c131025bb83b-mowiikrm-03.png)

_Positioning content in a person’s field of view keeps the UI visible and minimizes the need for excessive head or body movement_

### Embrace depth

Use elevation and 3D models to add volume, create a sense of realism, and spatial understanding.

![A person stands in front of an XR app with 3 curved panels and a 3D shark.](../../../../assets/images/a145aa8f399c-mowilveb-04.png)

_3D models can be viewed from all angles and moved with natural interactions_

### Design for accessibility

Design apps to work with system-level assistive technologies like screen readers, voice commands, and text resizing. Provide large target sizes, support multimodal inputs, and ensure text is legible against any background.

![1 XR settings icon button with labeled target size and offset. 1 microphone icon button with a visible cursor.](../../../../assets/images/3170bdcccf4b-mowin62l-05.png)

_In XR, icon buttons should have a 56dp target size and 4dp offset_

## Material XR components

The following Material components are adapted for XR:

-   [App bars](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/xr-components/app-bars/)

-   [Dialogs](../components/dialogs.md)

-   [Navigation bar](../components/nav-bar.md)

-   [Navigation rail](../components/nav-rail.md)

-   [Toolbars](../components/toolbars.md)

## XR terms

-   [3D models](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/3d-content): Digital objects rendered with depth and volume

-   [Field of view](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#where-place): The area a person can see without turning their head

-   [Full space](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/foundations#modes): Android XR’s immersive mode that supports spatial components

-   [Home space](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/foundations#modes): Compatible with mobile and large screen apps, but doesn’t support spatial components

-   [Orbiters](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#orbiters): Floating elements that control the content within spatial panels, full space only

-   [Passthrough](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/foundations#give-users): A blended reality where an XR device displays multiple large apps and the user’s physical environment

-   [Spatial elevation](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#spatial-elevation): Displays a component above an app on the Z-axis

-   [Spatial environments](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/environments): The 360° 3D virtual worlds people see in an immersive app

-   [Spatial panels](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#spatial-panels): A container for UI elements, interactive components, and immersive content, full space only
