# Design for immersive XR

Resources and guidance for immersive extended reality (XR) devices

![Design for immersive XR](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp6oo483-hero%20image.png?alt=media&token=e98832ea-27a5-45b3-8e22-8838005536d6>)

## Interaction

XR interactions should be flexible, comfortable, and intuitive. People expect to interact with digital objects just like they do with physical ones.

## Natural interactions

Natural interactions like gestures allow people to navigate, select, and move content using their hands. Gestures should be:

-   Easy to learn

-   Follow familiar patterns, such as press, pinch, and swipe on mobile

-   Comfortable to use repeatedly 


Support one-handed interactions for essential actions. Don’t require large, repetitive arm movements, as they can cause fatigue.

### System navigation

People should be able to open a navigation menu anywhere, anytime.  

On Android XR, the system-level navigation menu includes:

-   Go back: Operates the same as the [back gesture](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack) on Android phones

-   Launcher: Goes to the home screen

-   Recents: People can open, close, and switch apps

## Multimodal inputs

XR apps should support flexible, multimodal inputs, such as hand and eye tracking, voice, keyboard and mouse, and controllers.  

[More on Android XR multimodal inputs](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/foundations#design-multimodal)

### Hand & eye tracking

Tracking allows people to interact with the virtual world without a controller.

 Hand tracking

-   Direct: People can touch, grab, or push virtual objects in arm's reach

-   Ray-based: A ray, like a laser pointer, extends from the hand to target distant items, then a pinch selects it


Eye tracking

-   Enables gaze and dwell interactions

-   Looking at an object triggers a hover state

### Voice, keyboard, mouse, & controller inputs

XR apps should also support voice and physical inputs including:

-   Voice for hands-free text entry on virtual keyboards

-   Voice commands for common actions like **Open Settings** or **Go back**

-   Mouse & keyboard inputs for precision and text-heavy workflows

-   Six degrees of freedom (6DoF) controllers for gaming or complex 3D manipulation

## Motion

In XR, motion sickness can happen when visual cues disconnect from the inner ear's sense of balance.

To keep people comfortable:

-   Use [standard easing](../../../styles/motion/easing-and-duration/tokens-specs.md#601d5552-a6e6-4d74-9886-ff8f24b9ec35) and [long duration](../../../styles/motion/easing-and-duration/tokens-specs.md#48bf653e-46f9-48f5-87e0-eaf8ea3fe716) motion tokens

-   Maintain a stable horizon line

-   Limit continuous motion. To switch locations, use teleportation or instant jump instead.

-   Use tunnel vision or vignetting to reduce the field of view while in motion

## Feedback

Since virtual objects lack physical resistance, use visual, audio, and sensory feedback to confirm interactions.

### Visual cues

Use hover icons, focus indicators, ripples, text labels, and elevation changes to show an object’s interaction state.  

To indicate an item is targeted, use [spatial elevation](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#spatial-elevation) or a highlight state.

### Spatial audio

Sound emitters can be positioned in 3D space and provide audio confirmation of an action. For example, add a **click** sound when a button is pressed.

<video controls src="../../../../assets/videos/70c4b7367337-mowqk798-spatial-audio.mp4" title="As sound emits from 1 of 4 spheres, a person looks toward the active sphere."></video>

[Open video](../../../../assets/videos/70c4b7367337-mowqk798-spatial-audio.mp4)

### Haptics

For controllers, allow people to turn vibration on or off to simulate the feel of touching or grabbing an object.
