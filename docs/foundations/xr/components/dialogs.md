# XR components

Learn how Material 3 Expressive components adapt to extended reality devices

![XR components](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmp6grqe5-hero%20image.png?alt=media&token=77848b44-f2d9-4c6e-a51a-d4807d7ea9e4>)

## Dialogs

Note:

XR guidelines are primarily intended for designers. Find what’s implemented in code in the [design kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460).

Extended reality (XR) introduces spatial capabilities, such as using depth to make dialogs stand out from the background. Currently, [spatial dialogs](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) are only available in full space. For home space, follow Material’s general [dialog guidance](../../../components/dialogs/overview.md).

## Color & elevation

XR uses color roles to communicate the elevation of UI elements. Dialogs can use two color options: **surface container high** or **surface container highest**.

Note:

Color and elevation for spatial dialogs aren’t available in Jetpack Compose yet. These need to be customized manually.

_Surface container high; Surface container highest_

For effective visual hierarchy, a dialog should be the most prominent element. 

Add a scrim behind a dialog to improve its visibility. Scrims prevent other content from being selected until the dialog action is complete.

![Dialog with surface-container-highest color and a scrim.](<https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmox7g5yi-02.png?alt=media&token=7a21ccfd-5b6b-4840-a471-7dd6e803a83f>)

_Make sure a spatial dialog’s color is higher than all other UI elements, and use a scrim_

The dialog should have the highest elevation in the product.

For example, if the dialog is **surface container high**, don’t use **surface container highest** for any other elements.

_If a dialog’s color is surface container high, don’t use surface container highest for any other element_

## Usage

Only use [basic dialogs](../../../components/dialogs/guidelines.md#97ac3858-3932-4084-ae8e-73e42b7cb752) in XR. This keeps the required action in the person’s [field of view](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#where-place).

_Avoid using full-screen dialogs in XR. Required actions could appear beyond a person’s field of view._

## Spatial dialogs

In full space, dialogs can be elevated spatially via [overrides](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/material-design#use-enablexrcomponentoverrides). This helps dialogs stand out from their background in XR.

## Behavior

### Effect

The spatial dialog should scale uniformly. It also fades in when appearing, and fades out when disappearing. 

The dialog's scrim only fades in and out.

[Open video](../../../../assets/videos/ca94976b55a2-mox8cric-XR_Dialog_Behavior_01_IA_v02-.mp4)

### Movement

When activated, the spatial dialog rises from the app to the highest resting level on the Z-axis. 

When the action is complete, it returns to a normal resting level.

The dialog's scrim stays at the app content level at all times.

To prevent motion sickness, use [standard easing](../../../styles/motion/easing-and-duration/tokens-specs.md#601d5552-a6e6-4d74-9886-ff8f24b9ec35) and [long duration](../../../styles/motion/easing-and-duration/tokens-specs.md#48bf653e-46f9-48f5-87e0-eaf8ea3fe716) motion tokens.

## Placement

Consider factors like field of view, viewing distance, and possible interactions when deciding where to place dialogs in XR.

A dialog’s placement can be adjusted to accommodate specific needs, such as improved ergonomics or [right-to-left (RTL) languages](../../layout/bidirectionality-rtl.md).

### Elevation: Highest resting level

Display spatial dialogs at the **highest resting level**. When setting the depth value of the highest resting level, make sure the elevated dialog is at a comfortable viewing distance from the person. [More on spatial elevation](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#spatial-elevation)

### Center spatial dialogs in field of view

Spatial dialogs should be centered in a person’s [field of view](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/xr/guides/spatial-ui#where-place). If the dialog **can’t** track head movements, position it in the center of the app’s content. 

If the dialog **can** track head movements, configure it with a lazy follow behavior. This keeps the dialog anchored to the center of a person’s field of view until an action is taken.

## Accessibility considerations

[XR accessibility](../design/accessibility.md) guidelines are still evolving. Spatial dialogs should follow applicable Material [dialog accessibility standards](../../../components/dialogs/accessibility.md).
